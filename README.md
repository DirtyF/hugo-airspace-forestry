This project has been pre-configured to work with [Forestry](https://forestry.io) a git-based CMS, [import your repository in Forestry](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=DirtyF/hugo-airspace-forestry&engine=hugo&version=0.64.1) and you'll be able to edit and preview your site âœ¨. \

Any changes you make in Forestry will be commited back to the repo, and deployed if you use [Netlify](#netlify) or [ZEIT now](#zeit-now).

## Local development

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:DirtyF/hugo-airspace-forestry.git

# cd in the project directory
